This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To run the app:
### `node server/index.js` 

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

(when you add any changes in project always create build before running app as we are using server side rendering.)

To create production build:
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance
